# Slack User Party
A sample iOS application that displays a list of users and displays their profile. The app will additionally work offline through some basic caching functionality.

== Note ==
This app will not work out of the box. Please add a file called Secrets.swift defining "slackSecretToken" whose value will correspond to your Slack API Token.
